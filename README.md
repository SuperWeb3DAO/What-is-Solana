1. Introduction to solana
Solana is a decentralized protocol for building dApps with a reported throughput of 65,000
transactions per second (TPS) thanks to its distributed computing system. 
Unlike most protocol that run with the Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, 
Solana uses the Proof of History (PoH) – a new cryptographic mechanism that amplifies scalability 
while maintaining network security.

4.What is SOL token

SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It functions as a utility token. 
When making transfers or engaging with smart contracts, users pay SOL as transaction fees.
As part of its deflationary strategy, the network burns SOL.
Holders of SOLs can also serve as network validators. Solana, like Ethereum, 
allows developers to establish smart contracts and blockchain-based projects.

The SPL protocol is used by SOL. SPL is the Solana blockchain’s token standard, 
which is comparable to Ethereum’s ERC20.

5.What are Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are small computer programs that are replicated and processed on all the 
computers on the Blockchain network without a central coordinator. Smart Contracts allow you 
to program contracts that can be automatically enforced by computer code.



Solana is optimized for scalability. Does it have an edge over other blockchains? Find out by yourself in the article.
